# About the Book
The MEAN stack is a collection of the most popular modern tools for web development; it comprises MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js.

All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

You will see code something similar to the following:
